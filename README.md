# Scarne-s-Dice
Google Android Workshop project 2<br/>
Player vs AI roll a dice <br/>
if result is 1: lose all scores gained this turn. lose this turn <br/>
if result is 2-6: accumulate to this turn's score. choose continue rolling or hold <br/>
choosing hold will add this turn's score to total score and end this turn. \n
the first to reach 100 points wins this game.<br/>
<br/>
I've searched in Github for a solution to milestone 5. <br/>
I didn't really find any. Therefore I decided to write one myself <br/>
Here's my answer to it in "computer turn" method. Instead of the while loop, we can <br/>
recursively let the computer roll the dice and add a delay to it. <br/>
<br/>
I will improve the AI or the mechanic of this game later. <br/>
