# Scarne-s-Dice
Google Android Workshop project 2
Player vs AI roll a dice \n
if result is 1: lose all scores gained this turn. lose this turn \n
if result is 2-6: accumulate to this turn's score. choose continue rolling or hold \n
choosing hold will add this turn's score to total score and end this turn. \n
the first to reach 100 points wins this game.

I've searched in Github for a solution for tutorial milestone 5. \n
Here's my answer to it in "computer turn" method. Instead of the while loop, we can \n
recursively let the computer roll the dice and add a delay to it. \n
\n
I will improve the AI or the mechanic of this game later.
